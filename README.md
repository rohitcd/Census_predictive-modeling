# Property value prediction-Oklahoma
Predicting property values in Oklahoma
The purpose of this project will be to explore U.S. Census Bureau PUMS (Public Use
Microdata Samples) data to identify characteristics that are statistically related to variables which indicate property values in the state of Oklahoma. The two datasets, ‘Oklahoma Population Individual Details’ and ‘Oklahoma Housing Records’ will be scrubbed and merged using Python programming and the analysis will be facilitated by using SAS® Enterprise Miner. We would like to analyze and predict property values of residents within Oklahoma which would allow us to generate recommendations to banks, to realtors, and to consumers who want to purchase a home.
